# XII-Project-CPP
Automated ATM Machine with Card less Trasaction 

➢This is a program designed for a card less
  ATM.
➢This program consists of steps as followed:
  ▪ LOGIN with user name and password
  ▪ Enter the secret PIN
  ▪ TRANSACTION
  ▪ LOGOUT
  
  This is a completely custom coded Graphical Interface designed using C++ and implemented with Object Oriented Programming 
  
  The interesting Part of this Project 
  ------------------------------------
  
  All the functions are defined for particular functionality and made into header files.
  The main Program is inside a constructor of a class and that file is also saved as a header file.
  
  So the final Program, we need to import the header file and create object of that class.
  
  
  Happy Coding :)
  
  
  
  This Program was created for my grade XII Computer Science Investigatory Project (2017)
